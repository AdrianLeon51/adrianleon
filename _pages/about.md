Curious about the whys and hows in life.

*About Me*
------
![Illustration combining BCI and nature environment](images/Headset-nature.png){: .align-right width="300 px"}
I am Adrian Leon, a dedicated Ph.D. student in the field of Accessibility in Extended Reality (XR) at Tecnico Lisboa. With a background in Nanotechnology and a Master's in Electronics and Automation, my academic journey has been an exciting exploration of the convergence of technology and the human mind.


*Research Interests*
------

My research is centered around societal issues and the use of technology in benefit of society. 
Specifically, I am working on a holistic system that allows hands-free interaction in virtual environment, meaning locomotion, pointing and selection systems.
My research utilizes different tools like eye-tracking, voice recognition, facial gesture recognition and BCI, including virtual environment development in both VR and screen-based platforms, EEG signal acquisition, and the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques.


*Recent Publications*
------

[IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR LEARNING PHYSICS IN HIGHER EDUCATION](https://library.iated.org/view/OLMEDO2022IMM) - In this paper, I explore the use of immersive virtual technologies for enhancing physics education in higher education settings.

[Photochemical Reduction of Silver Nanoparticles on Diatoms](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/21/3/185) - This publication delves into the photochemical reduction of silver nanoparticles on diatoms, showcasing the interdisciplinary nature of my research interests.
