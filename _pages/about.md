Exploring Brain-Computer Interfaces for a Better Tomorrow


*About Me*
------

I am Adrian Leon, a dedicated Ph.D. student in the field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) at Tecnico Lisboa. With a background in Nanotechnology and a Master's in Electronics and Automation, my academic journey has been an exciting exploration of the convergence of technology and the human mind.


*Research Interests*
------

My research is centered around the fascinating world of Brain-Computer Interfaces. 
Specifically, I am working on developing a pipeline that not only facilitates faster learning for mind control but also enhances users' mental health and overall well-being. 
My research spans various aspects of BCI, including virtual environment development in both VR and screen-based platforms, EEG signal acquisition, and the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques.


*Recent Publications*
------

[IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR LEARNING PHYSICS IN HIGHER EDUCATION](https://library.iated.org/view/OLMEDO2022IMM) - In this paper, I explore the use of immersive virtual technologies for enhancing physics education in higher education settings.

[Photochemical Reduction of Silver Nanoparticles on Diatoms](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/21/3/185) - This publication delves into the photochemical reduction of silver nanoparticles on diatoms, showcasing the interdisciplinary nature of my research interests.



*Get in Touch*

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
